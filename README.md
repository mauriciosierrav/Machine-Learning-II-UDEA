9. **What are the underlying mathematical principles behind UMAP? What is it useful for?**

   UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique. The technique is based on underlying mathematical principles including differential geometry, algebraic topology and information theory. 

   UMAP has several applications, some examples are: finding a low-dimensional geometric representation of high-dimensional data while maintaining the global and local structure of the data; visualization of high-dimensional data; identification of groups or clusters in the data; feature selection and exploration of the underlying structure of the data.

10. **What are the underlying mathematical principles behind LDA? What is it useful for?**

      LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction and classification technique. The technique is based on several underlying mathematical principles, including probability theory and statistics, linear algebra and mathematical optimization.
   
      LDA has several applications, some examples are: finding a linear combination of the original variables that best discriminates between two or more classes of data; feature selection; exploration of the underlying structure of the data; reducing dimensionality and improving the efficiency of image processing.
